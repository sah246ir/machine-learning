## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sah246ir/machine-learning.git
cd machine-learning
```

### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

Creating a virtual environment allows you to keep dependencies isolated from other projects. To create and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:

- On **Windows**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required libraries, including:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

### 4. **Run the Tutorial**

After installing the dependencies, you can run the linear regression script. The Python code for training the model and visualizing results is available in `linear-regression.py`. You can run the script using the following command:
 
### 5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**

Once you're done playing around, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

```
linear-regression-algorithm/
├── linear-regression.py

## Troubleshooting

- **Module not found error**: Ensure you've activated your virtual environment and installed the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  
- **Dataset issues**: Ensure that `Salaries.csv` is present in the directory. If not, please download or create it.
